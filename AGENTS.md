# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Project Rules — Personal Portfolio Website

## 🚫 No Direct Code Changes Without Permission

1. **DO NOT** create, modify, or delete any source code files directly.
2. **DO NOT** run commands that modify the project (e.g., `npm install`, file writes) without explicit user approval.
3. Instead, **present all code in the chat** as code blocks for the user to review.
4. The user will **copy and paste** the code into the correct files themselves.
5. Always specify the **exact file path** where the code should be placed.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Guidance

1. Guide the user **one step at a time** — do not dump all files at once.
2. Clearly explain **what** each file does and **why** it's needed before showing code.
3. After showing code, wait for the user to confirm they've added it before moving to the next step.
4. If a step involves terminal commands (e.g., installing packages), show the command and let the user run it themselves.

## 📐 Alignment with Implementation Plan

1. All code and guidance **must align** with the approved implementation plan.
2. Reference the plan's file structure, component names, and design decisions.
3. If a deviation from the plan is needed, explain why and get user approval first.
4. Follow the data architecture: JSON files for content, TypeScript interfaces for types.
